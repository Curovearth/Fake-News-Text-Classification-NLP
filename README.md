The following project has been done as a part of the course where we focused at learning and implementing Natural Language Processing over news articles in the form of sentences and headings. Since we are beginners, we don't wish to take the entire credit of the code because we utilised this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ohseokkim/fake-news-easy-nlp-text-classification/notebook">Kaggle Notebook</a> as our base and explained more over this thoroughly.

Initially we thought of web crawling over reputed and renowned websites to extract the news headings but because of the time constraints we didn't implement it and instead used a kaggle dataset for the purpose.
